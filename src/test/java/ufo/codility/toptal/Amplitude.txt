Task description

A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. A subsequence of array A is any sequence obtained by removing some (possibly none or all) elements from A. The amplitude of a subsequence of array A is the difference between the largest and the smallest element in this subsequence. The amplitude of the empty subsequence is assumed to be 0.

For example, consider array A consisting of six elements such that:
  A[0] =  6
  A[1] = 10
  A[2] =  6
  A[3] =  9
  A[4] =  7
  A[5] =  8

These are some of the subsequences of array A and their amplitudes:

        subsequence [6, 6, 7] has amplitude 1;
        subsequence [6, 10, 6, 9, 7, 8] has amplitude 4;
        subsequence [6, 6, 7, 8] has amplitude 2;
        subsequence [9, 7] has amplitude 2;
        subsequence [9] has amplitude 0;
        subsequence [] has amplitude 0.

A subsequence of array A is called quasi-constant if its amplitude does not exceed 1. In the example above, the first, fifth and sixth subsequences are quasi-constant. Subsequence [6, 6, 7] is the longest possible quasi-constant subsequence of array A.

Write a function:

    class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the length of the longest quasi-constant subsequence of array A.

For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:
  A[0] =  6
  A[1] = 10
  A[2] =  6
  A[3] =  9
  A[4] =  7
  A[5] =  8

the function should return 3, as explained above.

Assume that:

        N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
        each element of array A is an integer within the range [−2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].

Complexity:

        expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
